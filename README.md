This repository contains various odds and ends for Limnoria running on
Python 3.4, developed for a bot on the #adom channel at IRCnet. They mostly
consist of various boredom expression and avoidance features that have
evolved over the span of several years and are unlikely to be of any
conceivable use to anyone. As such, you may also encounter some quite old and
smelly code. And possibly dragons.
